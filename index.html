            <h2>What is Bjj?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu" target="_blank">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a> is a grappling martial art that is predominantly ground-based. It is descended from Judo, which itself is descended from traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. More recently freestyle wrestling and greco-roman wrestling techniques have also been incorporated. Unlike most traditional martial arts, BJJ prioritises hard-sparring as a training method which ensures all techniques are battle-tested by encountering daily resistance by millions of practioners.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Training Method</h2>
            <p>The importance of hard-sparring as an aspect of the training method cannot be overstated. It trims the fat and unnecessary fluorishes from techniques, ensuring they are all technically sound and viable against opponents that have a size advantage on you. I would never practice a martial art that didn't incorporate regular hard-sparring rounds as a central aspect of training.<br><br> Practitioners often wear a kimono (or a gi) made from durable fabric during training, inherited from judo. A judoka or a jiu jitsu practitioner trains techniques that utilise an opponent's clothing to toss them to the ground or even choke them unconcious. To practice these techniques jumpers and T-shirts would result in the fabric being torn to shreds in minutes running up a huge Primark bill. A kimono is a useful, though not perfect, substitution for these things. <br><br> However, in the modern era of jiu jitsu roughly half of your training will be "nogi". This means you'll be wearing shorts and a T-shirt or a rashguard. During nogi grappling no grips can be made on clothing. This is partly to simulate fighting in MMA rules (the founders of BJJ also founded the UFC), and partly to satisfy the demands of the consumer market. Many practioners find the gi overly bulky and hot.</p>

            <h2>Why BJJ is like Javascript?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>There are sound governing principles that you must internalise.</b></li>
                <p>Javascript has data structures, loops, scope etc. In BJJ you have principles of leverage, weight and control.For example, pointing your oponents head to look down or to the side breaks the alignment of the spine, which leads to them being unable to effectively generate power.</p>
                <li><b>Technical problem solving</b></li>
                <p></p>
                <li>to feel like a more complete martial artist</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>However, the most important reason to train is the same as for any sport, to have fun. You'll find yourself watching technique videos after class, replaying moments from sparring in your head and constantly troubleshooting positions and techniques. The main thing that keeps people interested and working on getting better, is that it's just so fun!</p>
