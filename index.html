            <h2>What is Bjj?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu" target="_blank">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a> is a predominantly ground-based martial art, using the principals of leverage, angles, pressure and timing, as well as knowledge of the human anatomy, in order to achieve a non-violent submission of one’s opponent. Unlike other martial arts that focus on strikes and/or kicks, jiu jitsu focuses on close-contact “grappling” holds and techniques, and the application of chokes and joint-manipulations.</p>

            <h2>Gi and Nogi</h2>
            <p>The main difference between Gi and no-Gi BJJ is the use of the Gi, or kimono. Gi Jiu-Jitsu, or Gi BJJ participants wear the Gi, which consists of thick cotton pants and coat and a coloured belt that represents your current rank. The uniform isn’t just for show; it can be very advantageous while rolling as well as while executing different techniques like grappling and throwing.

                No-Gi practitioners generally wear rash guards, shorts, and spats underneath their shorts, mostly made from polyester.
                
                Advocates of No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu make the case that it’s easier to learn and has more real-life applications. After all, you don’t usually see people wearing traditional Japanese kimonos walking down the street. In a real street fight, a Gi might make you conspicuous or even be a liability. Meanwhile, many others believe that Gi BJJ is a better option because it simulates a situation in which an attacker can grab your clothing.</p>

            <h2>Why Train?</h2>
            <p>People train  in BJJ for all sorts of reasons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>fitness</li>
                <li>to meet new people</li>
                <li>to feel like a more complete martial artist</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>However, the most important reason to train is the same as for any sport, to have fun. You'll find yourself watching technique videos after class, replaying moments from sparring in your head and constantly troubleshooting positions and techniques. The main thing that keeps people interested and working on getting better, is that it's just so fun!</p>
