            <h2>What is Bjj?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu" target="_blank">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a> is a grappling martial art that is predominantly ground-based. It is descended from Judo, which itself is descended from traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. My first class was in 2016 and as today's date is <span id="date-time"></span>, that means I've been training for <span id="trainingtime"></span> years.</p>

            <h2>Training Method</h2>
            <p>The importance of hard-sparring as an aspect of the training method cannot be overstated. It trims the fat and unnecessary fluorishes from techniques, ensuring they are all technically sound and viable against opponents that have a size advantage on you. I would never practice a martial art that didn't incorporate regular hard-sparring rounds as a central aspect of training.<br><br> Practitioners often wear a kimono (or a gi) made from durable fabric during training, inherited from judo. A judoka or a jiu jitsu practitioner trains techniques that utilise an opponent's clothing to toss them to the ground or even choke them unconcious. To practice these techniques jumpers and T-shirts would result in the fabric being torn to shreds in minutes running up a huge Primark bill. A kimono is a useful, though not perfect, substitution for these things. <br><br> However, in the modern era of jiu jitsu roughly half of your training will be "nogi". This means you'll be wearing shorts and a T-shirt or a rashguard. During nogi grappling no grips can be made on clothing. This is partly to simulate fighting in MMA rules (the founders of BJJ also founded the UFC), and partly to satisfy the demands of the consumer market. Many practioners find the gi overly bulky and hot.</p>

            <h2>Why BJJ is like coding?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sound governing principles</b></li>
                <p>Programming languages have data structures, loops, scope etc. In BJJ you have principles of leverage, weight and control.For example, pointing your oponents head to look down or to the side breaks the alignment of the spine, which leads to them being unable to effectively generate power.</p>
                <li><b>Technical problem solving</b></li>
                <p>When solving a coding challenge or being pinned under an opponent, I envision a flow chart of my options and break down my route to a solution into steps. The biggest difference is in the speed that you have to make these decisions at.</p>
                <li><b>Freedom and creatuvity</b></li>
                <p>In both pursuits there are dozens of ways to achieve whatever you want to achieve, and you can express your preferences and your lineage by which ways you choose. What's more, the globally connected marketplace of ideas is always adding more and making others obsolete. Trends are birthed and then die soon after, while very sound approaches often endure for longer stretches of time.</p>
            </ul> 
            <p>I'm not sure if anyone will actually read this bit, but if you're into coding I think you might get addicted to bjj as well. You should try a class. I'll take you to my gym where you'll probably meet several other software engineers.</p>
